# birthday-tracker

This app is a simple birthday tracker written using the MERN stack. Users should be able to view a list of all birthdays created, add a birthday to the list, edit a birthday from the list, and delete a birthday from the list. 

To begin working with this repo: 

```
git clone <repo-url> 
cd birthday-tracker
yarn 
cd client 
yarn 
cd .. 
touch .env && touch .gitignore
```

Update your `.env` file so that it contains your unique MongoDB Atlas URI with the key `ATLAS_URI`. 

``` 
yarn dev
```
